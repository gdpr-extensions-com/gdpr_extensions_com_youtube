# GDPR-Extensions-com - Youtube 2xClick Solution

The GDPR-Extensions-com - Youtube 2xClick Solution allows you to add content elements and as many YouTube videos as you want on your website without being flagged by Cookie scanners!

This extension works in parallel with our GDPR-extensions.com Consent Manager, where your website viewer can update their cookie preferences at any time!

## Without GDPR-extensions.com Consent Manager:

- The YouTube cookie will not be created, and the user will not be able to view the video until they consent to the content mask that you style and hide the video.
- Once the user has consented, they are able to view the YouTube video, the cookie is created, and the default session duration is 30 days.
- The user will not be able to update their cookie preferences, and their data will be saved until the session has expired.

## With GDPR-extensions.com Consent Manager:

The GDPR-Extensions-com - Consent Manager Typo3 extension is powered by the gpdr-extensions.com dashboard. This scans your website and auto-detects cookies and external sources. It provides you with a content element “Consent Manager” that you can add to your website where all cookies are listed, and users can manage the YouTube 2 Click cookie at any time. Website viewers will be able to view the Consent Manager anytime by clicking on the cookie widget, which you can always customize its styling, language content, and position.
